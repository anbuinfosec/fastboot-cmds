# Essential ADB Fastboot Commands for Troubleshooting

ADB and Fastboot commands are powerful tools for Android users to troubleshoot and fix common device issues. This guide provides a list of essential commands and tips to help you take control of your device.

## ADB Fastboot Commands

### 1. ADB Devices
The first command to check if your device is properly connected:
```bash
adb devices
```
This will list all connected devices. If your device appears, you’re good to go. Otherwise, you may need to troubleshoot your USB connection or drivers.

### 2. ADB Reboot
To reboot your Android device, use:
```bash
adb reboot
```
This is useful when your device is stuck or not responding. You can also reboot into recovery or bootloader mode with:
```bash
adb reboot recovery
adb reboot bootloader
```

### 3. ADB Push
To transfer files from your computer to your Android device:
```bash
adb push <local_file_path> <remote_file_path>
```
Example:
```bash
adb push myfile.zip /sdcard/myfile.zip
```

### 4. ADB Pull
To transfer files from your Android device to your computer:
```bash
adb pull <remote_file_path> <local_file_path>
```
Example:
```bash
adb pull /sdcard/myfile.zip ./myfile.zip
```

### 5. Fastboot Flash Recovery
To flash a custom recovery like TWRP:
```bash
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
```
This command is essential for installing custom software on your Android device.

### 6. Fastboot Flash Boot
To flash a boot image:
```bash
fastboot flash boot boot.img
```
This is often used when installing a custom kernel or fixing boot issues.

### 7. Fastboot OEM Unlock
To unlock your bootloader for rooting or custom ROM installation:
```bash
fastboot oem unlock
```
> **Note:** Unlocking the bootloader will wipe all data on your device. Back up important data before proceeding.

### 8. Fastboot OEM Lock
To relock the bootloader:
```bash
fastboot oem lock
```
This is useful if you want to restore your device to its original state.

### 9. ADB Sideload
For manually installing a software update:
1. Boot into recovery mode.
2. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   adb sideload update.zip
   ```
This command is particularly useful when OTA (Over-The-Air) updates fail to install.

### 10. Fastboot Erase
To erase specific partitions (e.g., cache, userdata):
```bash
fastboot erase <partition_name>
```
Example:
```bash
fastboot erase cache
```

### 11. Fastboot Format
To format a partition:
```bash
fastboot format <partition_name>
```
Example:
```bash
fastboot format userdata
```

### 12. Fastboot Reboot
To reboot the device from Fastboot mode:
```bash
fastboot reboot
```
You can also reboot into bootloader mode using:
```bash
fastboot reboot bootloader
```

### 13. Fastboot Flash System
To flash a system image:
```bash
fastboot flash system system.img
```
This is useful for restoring stock firmware.

### 14. ADB Shell
To open a shell on your Android device:
```bash
adb shell
```
You can execute commands directly on the device from the shell. Example:
```bash
adb shell ls /sdcard
```

### 15. ADB Install
To install an APK file on your device:
```bash
adb install <apk_file_path>
```
Example:
```bash
adb install app.apk
```

### 16. ADB Uninstall
To uninstall an app from your device:
```bash
adb uninstall <package_name>
```
Example:
```bash
adb uninstall com.example.app
```

## Fixing Common Android Issues with ADB Fastboot Commands

### 1. Bootloop Issues
If your device is stuck in a bootloop, clear the cache partition with:
```bash
fastboot erase cache
```

### 2. Bricked Devices
For devices stuck in a "bricked" state (won’t boot at all), flash the stock firmware:
```bash
fastboot flash system system.img
```
> **Note:** Ensure you download the correct firmware for your device model before flashing.

### 3. Unresponsive Devices
If your device becomes unresponsive, reboot it using:
```bash
fastboot reboot
```
This simple command often resolves issues.

### 4. Insufficient Storage
To clear space by removing unnecessary files:
```bash
adb shell rm -rf /sdcard/<folder_or_file_name>
```

### 5. Debugging App Issues
To view the logcat (system logs) for troubleshooting:
```bash
adb logcat
```
You can filter logs for specific tags or errors, for example:
```bash
adb logcat *:E
```
